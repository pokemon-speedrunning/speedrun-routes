# Route 32 Manip

**Notes**:
  - This manip assumes the FFFF/FFEF Toto manip, r29 manips, and r30 and 3 quarters manip was used.  
  - First 3 frames, all frames are 60/60 and share the same path.
  - Pick up the Repel and have either A or B held when text is scrolling just like with Totodile manip.
  - 
**Saving**:
  - After exiting Falkners Gym, DO hop the ledge. Then save on [this](https://i.imgur.com/2nyhgXY.png) tile facing down.
  - You can pick up the Paralyze Cure Berry, it doesn't affect the manip.
 
**Emulator Offset**: 11945 (you can reuse your Post Mikey offset as it aims for the same frames!)
