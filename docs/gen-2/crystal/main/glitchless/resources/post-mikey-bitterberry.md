# Post Mikey Manip With Bitter Berry
### (Also known as r30 and 3 quarters manip)

**Name explanation**: https://pastebin.com/hPP1YMwb
 
**Notes**:
  - This manip assumes both the FFFF/FFEF Toto manip and r29 manips were used.
  - All paths are 60/60.
  - After beating Mikey, walk to the save tile facing upwards, equip the berry and call mom, then proceed to save.
  - After resetting, hit frame 10-12 (offset should be about -16ms of the raikou manip), all paths are the same.
  - When getting Bitter Berry, buffer all textboxes and have either A or B held when text is scrolling just like with Totodile manip.
  - Route 32 Manip will still work with the 2 added steps, but remember to account for those when doing Raikou Manip.
