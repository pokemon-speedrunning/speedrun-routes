The correct manipped stats are 21/13/12/10/11/10.

Take Totodile’s Berry off, if not manipulating you might want to check stats (12 attack required?)

Go to Mr. Pokemon
Kill one Level 2 Pidgey, Level 2 Sentret or Level 3 Caterpie if you encounter one (only on the way to Mr. Pokemon, not worth on way back since you’ll take damage before the rival fight)

If you are doing manips, pick up the hidden potion after Mr.Pokemon
Otherwise, skip and buy 4 potions in the mart

Rival 1: Leer once, spam Scratch

go back to the lab, name rival 1 char, skip the catching tutorial

pick up coin case from above (IMPORTANT)

walk left 1, up 1, left 2
Open pokedex, scroll with right until bellsprout, open summary to hear its cry
use coin case
walk down, left, up
talk to red (press A)


Notes for coin case setup:
- Croconaw always needs to be 4th in party and its movesets needs to be Scratch/Leer/FuryCutter/WaterGun, in this specific order
- Either Egg or Kenya in 3rd is ~71% to work with random DVs (L6 Bellsprout is 71%*(12/16) to work, L3 Bellsprout never works
- TODO: check sandshrew chances

If you want to finish the run, save after getting coin case. If the glitch fails try different pokemons in slot3.
If it keeps failing, you might have messed up TID/box names, or you got really unlucky
