#### Troubleshoot Collision+Corruption
- Check the time **BEFORE CONTINUE**, if it isn't 10:00/10:01 AM, redo main save corruption.
	- Otherwise, hit CONTINUE
- If save data is corrupted, reset
- For emulator, if you hit the collision frame and were lucky (1/3 chance), collision will be successful.
- Console has to hit a 1/3 frame window.
- Check if you have dex to confirm collision
	- If collision was not successful (no Pokedex in menu), pick up the Potion and redo collision setup
