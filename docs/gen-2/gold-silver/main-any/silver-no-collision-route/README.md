# Pokemon Silver Any% No Collision Route
## DISCLAIMER
- This route only works on Silver. Refer to the old route if you want to run on Gold without collision: https://pastebin.com/VDWfuung

## Pre-Run
- Clear saves before **every** attempt (even if no save file)
- Set options, no TID Manip needed, if doing r29 manip (doesn't exist yet lol) get ss0

## Intro
- Name player RRRRRRR (7 upper case R's; this is needed to maximize the chances of d0 glitch working at end).
- When talking to Mom, set day to Sunday (default). A/B/A/A to her 4 Yes/No questions.

## Lab
- Take any Cyndaquil (stats don't matter). Take off its Berry.

## Mr. Pokemon Quest
- Optional r29 Manip: lol nobody bots for silver
- Run away from all encounters until you have Poke Balls
- Rival: Leer spam
	- Winning isn't needed, so just hope for fast death
- Give Rival a 1 character name

## Second Route 29 Pass
- Catch something
	- Tackle encounters a second time before throwing a ball (if the second Tackle isn't a threat to kill)
	- If you get a second encounter, you can catch it to double the window for getting the bad clone, although it's fine to just run away (no need for a third poke for ACE)

## Cherrygrove
- Name boxes on Pokemon Center 1F
	- BOX 2: . (space) . n 'd 'v l
	- BOX 3: 'e × 2 H 'e ] 'd A
	- BOX 4: 'e g 'd n U 'e h 'd
	- BOX 5: 'v & 'e H 'd 'e [ 'd
	- BOX 6: p 'e d 2 'e 4 4
	- BOX 7: A 1
	- × in box 3 is the multiplication symbol
	- "Good" box naming reference video: https://youtu.be/5lv-F3XshvU (memorizing and practicing saves 20+ seconds)
		- Note this route has different box names, this video is from the old Gold route.
- Move w/o Mail to save
- Attempt bad clone (see notes below)
	- Deposit cynda from the top of the party
	- Open withdraw menu each reset to check if you got bad clone
	- Don't bother moving new pokes into party; just deposit cynda for each attempt
- Once successful, withdraw bad clone
- Walk to d0 save [tile](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld2?map=1#279/221), save
- Attempt d0 glitch (see notes below)
	- You only need to take 1 step down, so once you bonk spam A to talk to red

## Bad Clone Notes
**Timing**
- GBI hard reset: press A approx 26 frames before reset [video](https://youtu.be/6AK8Yc226fI?t=888)
	- Can use Flowtimer with a line like 440000, 440, 1000 to act as a metronome
- GBP hard reset: press reset approx 6 frames before A  [video]( https://youtu.be/TOseAPq8Pcg?t=723)
- GSR hard reset: same as GBP

**Cues**
- Early = no clone, Late = clone w/normal nickname, Very Late = deposited w/no clone.
- No nickname means you "hit the frame" (but bad clone itself is a subframe window)
- L0 can either be a "real" or "fake" bad clone
	- L0 males are guaranteed "fake" bad clones
	- If L0 female is created, it could be real or fake (can check stats for glitched type to confirm)
	- What matters for this run is the clone has no moves (technically possible even without the glitched type)

**Miscellaneous**
- First try bad clone is a ~1/48 frame window when depositing 1 pokes
- As the box fills up, the window gets larger; with a full box, it is around a 1 frame window
- If 19 or fewer in box, you can release pokes and retry bad clone
- If you fill up a box to 20/20 without getting bad clone, you must switch to a new box (releasing and retrying doesn't work)
- Many abnormal results (too many to cover) can occur if you reset at cycle-perfect times

**Type d0 Glitch Notes**
- Mash down on move screen (ACE exits to overworld, and you'll bonk on red once you go down)
- Press A or B if there is a textbox cursor to advance through
- This is an "RNG glitch" (depends on values in VRAM); it's only ~1/6 to work per reset
- Soft reset on hard locks, hard reset on crashes (playing around can get you used to what these look like)
- Can continue trying even if you get "funky colors", may need to back out of menu or reset if screen goes full white
