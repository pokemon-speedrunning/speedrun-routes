## Disclaimer: This route only works on Silver. Gold collision has to use the backup collision route.

## Disclaimer 2: This route requires you to hit a roughly 1/278 frame window. This window is around 10x smaller than first try 2 deposit bad clone, so hitting it is insanely hard. <br> However, if successful, this route essentially kills the category.

####
**Pre-Run**
####
- Clear save data
####
- Set fast text
- If doing r29 manip, get wStartSecond 0 (currently r29 manip doesn't exist for Silver so ignore this)
- TID manip is not needed
####
**Run**
####
- Name yourself "RRRRRRR" (left->down->spam A)
####
- IGT track #1 for frame 2-59 (you can probably use livesplit for this?)
####
- Save on (5,3) facing right buffered
	- https://i.imgur.com/FQhVN9N.png
	- Just buffer start after closing last elm textbox
	- Make sure to start a timer after hitting yes on save
####
- Get cynda, no nickname
####
- IGT track #2 for frame -2 of previous IGT
	- Add ~35327 to timer
	- If this is too hard to hit, you can wait another 59 frames (~36312 offset instead, also makes first igt have frames 1-59 work)
####
- Save on (2,4) facing down buffered

	- movement: https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld2?map=6149#5/3/LLLDS
####
- Reset while saving in (0x288D, 0x2891)
	- Same timer as second igt
	- GBI - add ~2500
	- GBP/GSR - add ~1960
	- The window is ~1/16 of a millisecond, expect to fine tune your offsets
####
- Do r29 manip (doesn't exist yet so ignore this)
- Cynda won't have any HP after collision, so you auto-win any wild encounter.
####
- Name boxes on Pokemon Center 1F
	- BOX 2: . (space) . n 'd 'v l
	- BOX 3: 'e * 2 H 'e ] 'd A
	- BOX 4: 'e g 'd n U 'e h 'd
	- BOX 5: 'v & 'e H 'd 'e [ 'd
	- BOX 6: p 'e d 2 'e 4 4
	- BOX 7: A 1
	- Asterisk in box 3 is the multiplication symbol
####
- Walk out of center
- Take one step down (should stand here: https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld2?map=1#279/221)
- Save
- Type d0 grind (spam Down for grinding)
- Take 1 step down, then press A to talk to Red
- End
