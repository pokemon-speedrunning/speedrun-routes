## Intro
- [Manip TID 64C2 (25794)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh7Z_frbfNs)
- Name yourself RED
- Name rival JOHN

## Save corrupt
- Open your menu and save:
  - on GBP or Gambatte, first reset then press A shortly after
  - on GBI, first press A then reset right after
- Save corrupting is a 4-frame windows, so you will probably need some practice with the timing
- Take 1 step down
- Open your Pokemon menu, swap
  - 11 -> 12
  - 13 -> 10
- Open Item, swap
  - Slot 1 (Gold Teeth) -> Slot 5 (j.x[38])
  - Slot 3 (Gold Teeth) -> Slot 13 (j.x[1], 1 below THUNDERSTONE)
- Open Pokemon again, swap:
  - 17 -> 22
  - 23 -> 18
- Close the menu, if you did everything right you will be warped to HoF

## Troubleshoot
- Save corrupt:
  - If you have no CONTINUE option after resetting, you went way too early with the reset
  - If the game says 'save data is destroyed', you went a little too early with the reset
  - If you can load the game and your pokemon menu opens, good job you got it
  - If you can load the game and your pokemon menu doesn't open, you went too late with the reset
