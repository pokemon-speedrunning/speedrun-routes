## The Route

### Intro

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/qF5VB9p.png">

Clear save data before each attempt with Up + Select + B on the title screen.

Hard reset and [manipulate the trainer ID 54878](https://youtu.be/upzxy_0KW7A).

Hold the A or B button while clearing textboxes with the other while the text speed option is still the default.

Name the player a one-character name like `A` or `I`.

Name the rival `AaRRSA×`, where × is the character below S.

### Pallet Town

Open the start menu and set the options to Fast/Off/Shift.

Optional: Withdraw the Potion from the PC.

You will be choosing **Bulbasaur** as the starter for the run:

- Advanced runners can choose to manipulate Bulbasaur's DVs for optimal fights and an always-working special stat for the Brock Through Walls glitch later on. This is not recommended for beginners because the manipulation can be very difficult to execute if you do not have experience clearing textboxes during RNG manipulations.

- Beginner runners should take a random Bulbasaur instead. Note having a bad attack stat on your Bulbasaur can make you lose turns on the Rival and Weedle Guy fights, and the fastest setup for the Brock Through Walls glitch ("Pidgey Strats") only has a 9/16 (~56%) chance of working with a random Bulbasaur.

Do **not** nickname the Bulbasaur, the name length is a requirement for the upcoming RNG manipulations to work.

To manipulate Bulbasaur: walk below the ball, then hold Up and press Start for a buffered save (required). Save, hard reset, and execute the manip's intro. After loading the save buffer a start flash, buffer A to interact with the ball, then while holding A or B clear every textbox perfectly, including the Yes for Bulbasaur and the No for nicknaming.

The IGT success rate on this manip is [56/60](https://pastebin.com/dUiiVZYS), but due to NPC timers the manip will fail an additional ~15% of the time.

More info can be [found on pastebin](https://pastebin.com/L14vtxJS) and a video with inputs can be [found here](https://youtu.be/VjLFyiX5JdA).

If you take a random Bulbasaur, you can check its stats at the start of the upcoming battle. Remember the special stat until it levels up in order to better know how likely the Bulbasaur will work for Pidgey Strats. The trainer ID is displayed in the bottom right corner of the stats screen so you can use this time to double check it as well.

### Rival Fight

Use Tackle on every turn. Heal up with a Potion if at 6 health or below. Winning the fight is required.

After defeating the Charmander you will level up to 6. If you did not manipulate the Bulbasaur now is the perfect time to check your special stat:

- 11 special → 12 special at level 6 = reset (no chance of working)
- 11 special → 13 special at level 6 = go for level 8 (50% chance to work)
- 12 special → 13 special at level 6 = go for level 8 (100% chance to work)
- 12 special → 14 special at level 6 = go for level 7 (33% chance to work)
- 13 special → 14 special at level 6 = go for level 7 (100% chance to work)

Note regardless of the level 5 special stat, 13 at 6 will always try to go for level 8, and 14 at 6 will always try to go for level 7. A manipulated Bulbasaur will always go for level 7.

### Route 1

If you are going for level 8 you have to kill one encounter for experience: level 2-3 Rattata or level 2 Pidgey is ideal. This will level Bulbasaur from 6 to 8 after the Weedle Guy fight, skipping learning Leech Seed at level 7. Backup PP strats will want to kill additional encounters to reach level 7 before Weedle Guy in this case.

Run from all other encounters and deliver the parcel, then head back to Viridian.

### Viridian City

Enter Viridian Mart and buy:

- 4 Poke Balls
- 1 Parlyz Heal

### Route 2

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/MCefV9n.png">

Manipulate a **Pidgey** encounter & catch with `nopal(ab)` and the path shown. This Pidgey will always have HP that works for Brock Through Walls and will always catch, so a random Pidgey is not a viable alternative.

Ideally you extend the Pidgey manip into a **Caterpie** by clearing Pidgey's textboxes and Pokedex entry perfectly, then by moving `L R R U` afterwards, or by doing the [forest Caterpie extended](#rng-manipulations) (with npcs `DU,rl,ud`). For beginners, or if an issue occurs, a solo Caterpie manip is an option once inside Viridian Forest.

### Viridian Forest

If you still need a Caterpie, use the [Non-extended Caterpie Manip](#rng-manipulations) inside the forest.

Otherwise, [follow this path](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=51#17/47/UUUURRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUULUURRUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUALLUUUUUUUUUUULLALLALLALLADADADADADADADALLLLAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUAUUULLLLLLDDDADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADALLLLALLUUUU) because many tiles in Viridian Forest do not give encounters, which are indicated in green on this map.

Pick up the Antidote in both cases.
You need at least 1 Potion **after** the next fight, so pick up [the hidden potion](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?local=51#1/18) if you don't have one.

Spam Tackle to defeat Weedle Guy. Heal up with a Potion if at 3 health or below. Bulbasaur must have 16 special when it levels up after this battle. If so, continue to Pewter.

If not, you may be able to switch to PP strats to meet the requirements for Brock Through Walls instead of forfeiting the attempt. PP strats require Bulbasaur to:

- be level 8
- know Leech Seed in slot 1
- know Tackle in slot 2 with 16 PP remaining
- know Growl in slot 3 with 36 PP remaining

Find wild encounters until these conditions are met.

### Pewter City

Open the start menu and move the cursor to Save.

Enter Pewter Mart and buy:

- 1 Burn Heal
- 1 Escape Rope (into slot 6)

Brock Skip by holding Start after clearing the gym guy's last textbox with B, saving the game, and soft resetting.

After loading the save, walk to Route 3 and back to reload Pewter, then talk to the gym guy from the right. (PP strats need to swap Bulbasaur to the last party slot here before talking to the gym guy.)

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/pG2E8zC.png">

Hold B after the textboxes to be able to Brock Through Walls.

Navigate to Diglett's Cave. The simplest path to avoid the out-of-bounds area is to turn after the mart door, as shown in the picture.

### Diglett's Cave

Brock Through Walls ends upon entering the first cavern.

Save the game immediately after climbing down the ladder. Hard reset and use the [Diglett's Cave Manip](#rng-manipulations) with `pal` for no encounters, or use the [Dugtrio Manip](#rng-manipulations) with `pal` for an early Dugtrio (and 1 less space in Box 1).

### Vermilion City

Enter Vermilion Center. Deposit all Pokemon except Pidgey then heal before leaving.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/m1QUvIU.png">

Go to Route 11 to do the deathfly manip with `nopal(ab)`. After respawning in Vermilion, talk to [the Dux girl](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#235/193) but say no to the trade, then flash the start menu before leaving her house. Returning to Route 11 will open the start menu and closing it will activate the Missingno deathfly. Stall (don't run) until you black out.

Repeat the above but this time toss 2 Escape Ropes before you save for the manip.

### Item Underflow #1

- Talk to the item ball, catch the **Golem** that appears

Cerulean Cave is filled with Pokemon we call **bonuses**. They are typically evolutions of Pokemon we catch throughout the run. Catching bonuses will save withdrawing the pre-evolution, candying it, watching it evolve, and depositing it. In general, if it's on your screen and you don't have it, catch it unless the notes say otherwise.

Every wild encounter in Cerulean Cave is a bonus. Proper use of dsum manipulation here can save a lot of time. Pokemon worth catching in order from best to worst: **Hypno**, **Kadabra**, **Dodrio**, **Sandslash**, **Magneton**, **Parasect**, **Venomoth**, **Electrode**, **Rhydon**, **Marowak**, **Wigglytuff**, **Raichu**, **Golbat**.

You are limited on box space so do not catch more than 10 (9 if manipped Dugtrio) of the above. Magneton does not count towards the limit. Do **not** catch Chansey and Ditto, those two will be obtained later.

In Celadon move **1** tile left, swap Great Ball x1 in inventory with Rare Candy x0 in x coord, then hop on the bicycle in map ID.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/Emo674H.png">

Follow the path shown, it will lead you to Route 16 with a trainer fly waiting. Catch the **Dragonite** that appears.

Use jack to get on the tree to the right of **Snorlax**, then play the Poke Flute to wake it up (you don't need to unjack).

| |
|---|
| Route 16 |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/MWKm80b.png) |

Just like in Victory Road, catch everything but 1 of: **Spearow**, **Rattata**, and **Doduo**.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/4t1Qy3h.png">

In the first unneeded encounter LG for **Rhyhorn**.

After catching Rhyhorn, move **1** tile up, **swap Master Balls into slot 1** (swap with Bicycle), then **use** "4" and catch the **Metapod** that appears.

Undo the swap the next time you open the item menu.

Once you have all but 1 of the required wild Pokemon, get an encounter and LG for **Kabuto**.

If you are missing Spearow or Doduo use "4" on the **right** Horsea tile, or if you are missing Rattata use it on the **left** Horsea tile.

Run from the Metapod encounter (which gives you flipped sprites!).

Alternate up and down steps until you get an encounter, then do the following:

- Use 9F
- Open items (do **not** flash map or trainer card)
- Flash "4" and throw a Master Ball to catch **Horsea**
- Swap Master Ball x[]8 in inventory (**not** main stack) with Moon Stone x0 in rival name
- Swap the unnamed item in rival name (from Victory Road) with x coord, which is either a Repel or an Escape Rope
- Manip the final encounter

||||
|---|---|---|
| <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/f2eSneP.png"> Spearow with `pal`, `hop2` | <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/Bw0vz21.png"> Doduo with `nopal(ab)`, `fsback` | <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/QAl4Gpi.png"> Rattata with `nopal(ab)` |

After the manip encounter ends, bike left until you are outside the grass, then hold down until the start menu opens. Fly to Pewter and catch **Mew**.

### Pewter City + Route 3

Enter the center, **change boxes**, then leave the center.

Use jack and bike to the **right** of the gym guy used for Brock Through Walls. Unjack and talk to him, then while holding Select move right until a trainer fly ("brock fly") textbox opens. Close it and catch the **Goldeen**.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/9zEXBwi.png">

After the brock fly, open the item menu, swap jack in slot 6 with Fire Stone x99, then toss 12 from Awakening x182 in map ID. You are now on the green tile in the picture, bike to the grass to search for an encounter.

<ins>Warning:</ins> if you go 1 tile too far left you will be back in Pewter.

Catch the encounter if it's a **Jigglypuff**, otherwise LG for **Cubone**.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/lsBwMzA.png">

Manip Jigglypuff with `gfwait` if you still need one. If it's already caught, move to the Metapod tile in the picture then **use** "4" to generate a Metapod encounter and run away from it.

Bike back to the tile you arrived at originally and move **1** tile left to return to Pewter. After the gym guy's text, move right then left to reload Pewter, then go left some more and talk to the gym guy again. While holding B, make your way towards the gym. **Flash the start menu** before entering.

In the trainer fly menu do the following:

- Evolve Exeggcute, NidoranF, Paras (if needed), and Nidorina
- Swap Super Potion x83 in inventory with Ultra Ball x0 in brightness
- Swap Super Potion x83 again with j. x2 in warping

Exit the menu and catch **Oddish**. Exit the gym to warp to the Power Plant.

### Power Plant

| |
|---|
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/17FX3Cv.png) |

Dsum for either a **Magnemite** or a **Pikachu** (the other can be manipped later). Do not catch Voltorb. At some point, talk to **Zapdos** and catch it too.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/rv7mAXt.png">

After Zapdos, walk to the tile in the picture and do the following:

- Swap Fire Stone x99 in slot 6 with jack
- Swap Awakening x20 in rival name with HM04 in TLP2
- Toss all-but-8 from Max Elixer x136 above
- Walk **1** tile right and talk to the ball, catch **Voltorb**

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/qInnztJ.png">

Get an encounter **1** tile down from where you talked to Voltorb, then LG for **Farfetch'd**:

- Use 9F
- Flash **trainer card**
- Flash "4"
- Throw a Master Ball

If you still need **Magnemite** or **Pikachu**, do one of the following manips.

In the manipped encounter, **use 9F while holding a direction** (double input works).

|||
|---|---|
| Magnemite | `pal(hold)`, `D D U R D` |
|||
| Pikachu | `pal`, `D D U U U D D` |

Otherwise, **use 9F in the menu while holding left or right**.

After "9F warping" walk **1** tile right, jack **1** tile up, press Down and hold while opening the start menu, and unjack. (You need to see yourself **facing down**.)

LG for **Squirtle** & friends:

- Swap Antidote x4 in inventory with Coin Case in TLP2
- Toss 4 from "JACK" x255 one slot above (if not tossable, flash toss Antidotes)
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 in brightness with Potion x2 in tileset
- **If you 9F warped from a manip, throw a Master Ball from warping**
- Swap Parlyz Heal x1 in x coord with j. x64 in map data (4 slots down)
- Swap Burn Heal x84 in text pointer with Poke Ball x4 in width
- Toss 73 Burn Heals
- Swap the Poke Ball x4, now in text pointer, with Ice Heal x78 in rival name
- Close the menu, talk to the cashier now in front of you to get **Hitmonlee**
- Flash WA4 in options then throw a preoptions Master Ball
- Fly to Celadon

### Route 7 + Silph Co.

Enter the center, deposit Pidgey, Paras(ect), Nidoqueen, and Exeggutor, then **change boxes**.

Use Bicycle in map ID to bike to the prize corner and purchase:

- **Abra**, **Clefairy**, and **Nidorino** from the left window
- **Dratini**, **Pinsir**, and **Porygon** from the middle window

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/o5fYYEN.png">

Leave the prize corner and bike to Route 7.

Get an encounter and catch it if it's **Bellsprout**. If it's not, LG for **Mankey**. The tile you move to depends on what you will do after the LG:

If you need Bellsprout, move to the **left Mankey tile** and manip after.

If you already caught Bellsprout, move to the **right Mankey tile** and utilize the Metapod tile after. Move to the Metapod tile in the picture then **use** "4" to generate a Metapod encounter and run away from it.

| |
|---|
| <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/kzMYCjP.png"> Bellsprout |

After having caught Bellsprout and Mankey, get an encounter and LG for **Ivysaur**:

Enter the center again and swap the Revives with the Poke Dolls again. Talk to Nurse Joy to receive **Omanyte**, give her an Old Amber, and **change boxes**.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/K2toQQL.png">

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/hwBdghB.png">

(While learning, you may find it helpful to watch a run complete this section, because the map graphics will not fully update to match the picture.)

The picture shows where the three LGs are located on the glitched map.

You begin on the Lickitung tile, and talking to the Lickitung tile gives you an Eevee.

<ins>Warning:</ins> walking to the top row of tiles pictured will take you to Mansion 1F. Do not cross the connection until you have completed this section.

LG for **Lickitung**:

- (Flash map if you did not already)

### Cinnabar Mansion

Swap HM04 in TLP2 with Poke Flute in inventory, then manip **Weezing** with <ins>extra text while saving</ins>. You do not need to move before saving for this manip.

| |
|---|
| <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/z8KlzpG.png"> Weezing with `pal(hold)` |

| |
|---|
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/pQ7EITv.png) |

Dsum for either a **Grimer** or a **Ponyta** (the other can be manipped later). Muk can appear as a bonus.

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/phbDTnb.png">

Make sure your three-step-rule will end then use jack to get on the tile in the picture. Bonk for an encounter (you don't need to unjack) and LG for **Electabuzz**:

- Use 9F
- Flash map
- Flash "4" then throw a Master Ball

Manip one of the following:

|||
|---|---|
| <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/g8fPXm1.png"> Grimer with `hop1` | <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/UkY3NTF.png"> Ponyta with `pal(hold)` |
|||
| <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/opi33H2.png"> Muk wih `nopal(ab)`, `fsback` | <img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/GawJkTb.png"> Weezing with `pal`, `hop2`, `fsback` |

After having caught Grimer, Ponyta, and Weezing, use an Escape Rope <ins>from badges</ins>, then enter Vermilion center.

### Audio Fade Out ("AFO")

Walk below the PC, face up, and menu to set up the AFO glitch city:

- Swap HM04 in TLP2 with Master Ball x5 in warping
- Toss 1 from the Master Balls you just swapped

- Swap roaming TMs with Poke Ball x7 in width
- Toss 6 TMs
- Flash map
- Toss the entire stack of Parlyz Heal x65 below
- Swap "4" with Ultra Ball x0 in inventory (above Rare Candies)

In this glitch city, flashing "4" will cause the audio to fade out for about 33 seconds. All jingles do not have a delay during the fade out, such as using Rare Candies, the cries when depositing and withdrawing Pokemon, and changing boxes. An evolution will cause the fade out to end immediately, so flash 4 again after each one. (You shouldn't bother scrolling to and flashing 4 for stone evolutions.)

Evolve everything you need to in boxes 7 through 2 this way. (Box 1 will always be filled with Pokemon that do not evolve.)

When done, deposit all but 1 Pokemon then do the following menu:

- Swap Master Ball x[]8 in rival name with HM04 in north connection (**second** HM04 scrolling down)
- Swap "F" in text pointer (up 2) with TM40 x[]2 in width
- Swap Master Ball x4 in TLP2 with Ultra Ball x0 in brightness

<img align="right" src="https://i.imgur.com/ErqwNmg.png">

Walk **1** tile up to warp to the Hall of Fame!

Timing ends when the screen fully fades to white after 151 Pokemon are displayed in the Pokedex.
