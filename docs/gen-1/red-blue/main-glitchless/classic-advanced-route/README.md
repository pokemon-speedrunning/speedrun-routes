This guide uses fairly aggressive Carbos strategies. If not going for a top leaderboard time it is suggested to use one of the safer strats involving extra candies instead of X Speed Sabrina strats. See [this pastebin explanation](https://pastebin.com/sEWrd0v8) and the [complete speed chart](https://imgur.com/MpKBIb1) for more information.

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for Pokemon Red
	- Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a Classic speedrun is not allowed
	- If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
	- Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from Classic

### Before you start

- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator**
- Set your options to fast text and animations OFF

- There are options here with pros and cons to weigh. Play safely on good enough pace.
WA is 28 damage or 25 damage w/badge boost
- X Speed first 23-27 is an option; as is Full Restore or Super Potion if Sky Attack turn 1 on good pace
- Yolo Strat at 1-23 or 28-30 or just in red bar is to X Acc turn 1 and respond to Sky Attack with HD and take the risk using X Speed on Zam (~⅓ to live)
