This guide uses fairly aggressive Carbos strategies. If not going for a top leaderboard time it is suggested to use one of the safer strats involving extra candies instead of X Speed Sabrina strats. See this [carbos strategies document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaLiYjPanRiGSnToYBXKrEx47xVX7LlWNw5C81cBVN0/edit?usp=sharing) and the [complete speed chart](https://imgur.com/MpKBIb1) for more information. Also see the [Red Classic FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUEFqLjl20FsY3j7LESRhIstvah4CZLe0GDUnD59P-E/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.  
This route additionally makes use of stacking carbos (using them all at once inside mansion rather than one at time to reduce the time spent scrolling). See the [Red Classic Optimal Carbos Stacking pastebin](https://pastebin.com/djuHjgRU) for more detailed information and review the [inventory spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Qg4cbjQ8FacZhHdKiqVqMIB7eSOU0_frzE3HAVIrBY/edit?usp=sharing) for all the different late game menus.  

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for Pokemon Red on emulator
	- Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a Classic speedrun is not allowed
	- If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
	- Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from Classic

### Before you start

- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator**
- Set your options to fast text and animations OFF

Turn 1 Sky Attack Basics:
- Yolo Strat after using X Acc turn 1 is to HD Pidgeot, X Speed on Zam (~⅓ to live), and HD all. 
- Safe Strat after using X Acc turn 1 is to either Full Restore (or Super Potion if it heals enough).
- Yolo Strat after using X Speed turn 1 is to either...
  - X Acc turn 2 and hope for a miss or
  - Yolo Drill Pidgeot, EQ(+EQ) Zam, X-Acc Rhydon, HD the rest. 
- Safe Strat after using X Speed turn 1 is to...
  - Full Resore if you are using x-speed in red bar
  - Super Potion if you are using x-speed w/"high" HP

Further explanation regarding when to consider X Speed turn 1:
- Using X Speed first is a good option if...
  - (1) it allows you to live one non-crit Wing Attack that otherwise would have KO'd without a defense badge boost 
  - (1) if it allows you to respond to turn 1 Sky Attack with Super Potion resulting in red bar off of any non-crit. 
- As an example, consider a Nido w/ 7 Defense DV.
  - (1) with ~23-26 HP we might X Speed turn 1 to guard against wing attack.
  - (2) with ~41-5X HP we might X Speed turn 1 to allow us to respond to sky attack with Super Potion.
