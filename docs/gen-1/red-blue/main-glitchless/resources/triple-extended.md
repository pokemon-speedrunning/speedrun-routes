**DISCLAIMER**: This is really hard, consider focusing on other execution sections if you are a beginner

How to execute it ([Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kEtNFC8_Bjw)):
- Buffer the SAVE
  - press start while still walking on the save tile, if you stop on the tile then START Nidoran manip will work but the extend might fail
- Clear every textbox within its 4 frame window without mashing
- While doing so, remember to always have A or B held down
    - You can do this by either holding one and press the other to clear the textbox, or alternate A/B
- Beware that 'A wild Nidoran...' can be cleared withing 8 frames for the yoloball to work, but you need to hit the first 4 frames for the extend to work
- Renaming Nidoran is the only thing that doesn't have a 4-frames window
  - That's why we have multiple paths: the higher the path the later you renamed it
- Watch the NPC movements to recognize what path you hit, and execute the relative pidgey extend
  - if you are unsure who they are, click on their names in the table
- Note that Pidgey is a shorter name then NidoranM so the timing might throw you off at first
- Clear Pidgey textboxes the same way as Nidran ones
  - everyone of them is a 4-frame window
- Check NPC movement again to check if you hit the forest extend or not, and follow the forest path if you did it
  - here you might pick the one with potion or without based on your HP and the risk you want to take
- When picking up Antidote/Potion, remember to keep A held until the text stop printing
- Talk to the Bug Catcher and clear its textbox with B
- Switch to hold A when you hear Squirtle cry, and quickly do Down(or UP)+A to buffer Tail Whip
  - this is the hardest part so you will need some practice

Glossary:
  - 'r' means NPC is looking RIGHT
  - 'R' means NPC moves RIGHT
  - u->L means NPC is looking UP, then moves LEFT
  - r->D/L means NPC is looking RIGHT, then moves DOWN or LEFT

  - almost everything you need in one image to help while doing runs


NOTES:
- The house movement was changed to turn right on the last possible tile, except path 3
- for path 5-6 do 2 A presses between NPC1 and NPC2 (my bot does them [here](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#58/177)  and [here](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#58/175))
- Paths 7 and 8 only have Pidgey, no Forest or String Shot manip
- Path 9 only have Forest, no Pidgey or String Shot Manip

## Forest / String Shot paths with Potion
credits to hwangbro

Based largely on the original Triple Extended Manip, everything is unchanged until the last path down in the forest

Same base NPC cues as above
