# FAQ Pokémon Red Any% Glitchless Speedruns

## What should I do if I want to run this game?

Here are the first things you should do:
- Play through the game casually so you know the basics of a Pokémon game. [Strategy Wiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue#Table_of_Contents) is an excellent casual guide.
- Join the [Gen 1-3 Pokémon Speedrunning Discord](https://www.speedrun.com/pokemon/thread/r7a65)
- Watch [this run (as it uses the updated route)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR9HKr61HJY) to learn more about the speedrun
- Decide what category you want to run and get a guide here (we recommend the beginner guides with revives):
	- [Glitchless](../)
	- [Classic](../)
- Start learning the game and have fun!

## What route should I use?

The WR for Red is HIGHLY competitive and involves a lot of risk that is minimized in the beginner guide. If you are new to running Red we recommend starting with the beginner guide since it is designed to be close to the WR route with extra safety.

## What hardware can I run this game on/Do I need to buy anything to run this?

You can find the [full list here](https://pastebin.com/1BJgj2cS) but we recommend the approved Emulator, Gameboy Player, Gameboy Interface, or a GBA in general since the standard RNG manips won't work on anything that isn't one of these.

## I want to run on emulator, how do I get everything?

See the [guide here](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/guide/wf0la):
- Download the [approved emulator (download the psr version)](https://github.com/pokemon-speedrunning/gambatte-speedrun/releases)
- Download the GBC Bios (link in the guide above)
- Load the Bios into the emulator and you are good to go!

## What is the difference between Glitchless and Classic?

Classic is Glitchless with three major changes:
1. No Hard Resets/RNG manipulation.
2. No Instant Text
3. No Pokedoll skip (Using the pokedoll on the ghost in Pokémon Tower)

## What is Instant Text?

Instant Text is a natural oversight in the game where talking to the bike sales man without the bike voucher and closing his final dialog with B will set the text speed to instant. This isn't a glitch in the communities eyes, and is NOT permanent. Here are some things that kill IT:
- Opening the menu outside of battle
- Opening the Pokémon or Item menu in battle
- Any Yes/No textbox

## Why did the WR video save and reset/What is RNG manipulation?

You can manipulate RNG in Pokémon Red, which is all done by hard resetting the console (save and reset). With that you can get the perfect Nidoran, get no random encounters in Mount Moon, and solve the Surge cans puzzle.

## RNG manipulation seems daunting, should I learn it right away?

No actually! Only one simple RNG manipulation is needed to run this category, [Nidoran manip](nido-manip.md), and you can ignore all other manips until you know the route more (but Surge cans manip is also very simple).

There is another category with no RNG manipulation: [Any% Glitchless (Classic)](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/guides/zuzgp).

## Why is my manip failing?

It's most likely you are doing something wrong:
1) A Presses - You have a 17 frame window to press A and you don't just want to lightly tap it make sure it's pressed! [Picture of A Press window](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/425297133382533122/741663432633221161/image0.png)
2) Intro - Everything from the the hard reset needs to match. EVERYTHING. The intro included. If the video shows an input you have to do it the same.
3) Movement - You want to do the movement 100% correctly so double check. Also make sure you are holding the first direction as the game loads. You are basically buffering the first movement.
4) IGT - There is a small chance your manip will fail and we call it an IGT failure. If you get the same failure every time you try or, you suddenly get failures after learning a manip it might be IGT.
5) MISC. - There could be 100 things going wrong, but you can ask in the #red-blue-glitchless channel in the PSR discord. We recommend recording yourself doing the manip with an input viewer.

Make sure to watch the [RNG manipulation tutorial video](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/guide/9oea2)

## What is triple extended?

You can do 3 manips that are [extended](triple-extended/) from the Nidoran manip.
1) Pidgey manip and catch.
2) Forest no encounter manip
3) String Shot turn 1 from the Bug Catcher in Forest

WARNING: This manip only saves about 20 seconds and can be extremely hard to learn. We suggest getting times around 1:50 before even trying to learn this manip, as your time is better spent learning other sections of the run.

## In which order should I learn things? When should I drop the beginner route?

This page is a good roadmap of what to learn depending of your current time:
- [Red Glitchless: Begin to Advanced](https://pastebin.com/UUpT5n27)

## When should I reset my runs?

The simple answer is try not to reset. Set a PB then if you even have a small chance of beating that time finish out the run!

## But the early game is too good in my PB!

If you are reading this, you most likely have huge amounts of timesave in the late game and you never need to reset the early game, see this page:
- [How to get better times in Red](https://pastebin.com/xLE6W0eK)

## Any tips for improving my time?

Races are a great way to improve. You are actively playing with other runners, working on the entire run. [This discord](https://discord.gg/4mAWWz6) is a great place to find other runners to race.

## Why do you do X in the run?

You can ask any questions about the route in the PSR discord. We keep the guides simple for new runners, but there is a lot that goes into routing.

## When should I heal?

You can follow one of these pages or refer to your guide:
- [Safety-oriented HP Strats](hp-strats-for-races.md)
- [Aggressive HP Strats](hp-strats.md)

## What should I practice the most?

The late game is important to practice. Many new runners get the early down by doing runs but struggle on good runs in the late game.

## Are there practice saves?

Yes! On the [resource page](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/resources).

## Should I be saving?

Yes! When starting out saving is a great idea. Here is a list of good saving points in the run:
- Before Brock (Bad Special)
- Before the Oddish girl in Rock Tunnel (Low HP)
- Before Black Belt in Giovanni's Gym
- Before Agatha
- Before Lance
- Before Champ Fight
