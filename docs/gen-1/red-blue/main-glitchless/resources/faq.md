# FAQ Pokémon Red/Blue Speedruns

## What should I do if I want to run this game?

- Play through the game casually so you know the basics of a Pokémon game. [Strategy Wiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) is excellent for new players. 
- Join the [Gen 1-3 Pokémon Speedrunning Discord](https://www.speedrun.com/pokemon/thread/r7a65)
- Decide what category you want to speedrun.
	- [Red Glitchless](/docs/gen-1/red-blue/main-glitchless/beginner-route/) and be sure to watch [this run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR9HKr61HJY) and the [RBY Manip Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QirPrbub21g)
	- [Red Classic](/docs/gen-1/red-blue/main-glitchless/classic-beginner-route/)
	- [Blue NSC (No Save Corruption)](/docs/gen-1/red-blue/main-nsc/) and watch the [RBY Manip Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QirPrbub21g)
	- Red Any% and Blue CEA (Catch 'Em All) are also options on the main leaderboard, but are less common as starting points. 
- Start learning the game and have fun!

## What hardware can I run this game on/Do I need to buy anything to run this?

You can find the [full list here](https://pastebin.com/1BJgj2cS) but we recommend either the latest version of an approved emulator (either GSE or Gambatte-SR), Gameboy Player, Gameboy Interface, or a GBA. The RNG manips for the glitchless speedrun will not work in the same way for other platforms. Check the [SRC leaderboard page](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue) for the most up to date rules. 

## I want to run on emulator, how do I get everything?

You can get a link to the most recent version of GSE from SRC leaderboard page or see the [guide here for gambatte-sr](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/guide/wf0la):
- GBC-Bios.bin is required for either emulator. It is not difficult to find, but we legally cannot share it so don't ask.
- Load the Bios into the emulator and you are good to go!

## What is the difference between Glitchless and Classic?

First a short vocab lesson, we typically refer to Red/Blue Any% Glitchless (Classic) as "Red Classic" or just "Classic" and similarly shorten Red/Blue Any% Glitchless as "Red Glitchless" or "Glitchless". With that out of the way Glitchless allows manips, instant text, and the pokedoll skip. Classic bans all three. 

In Classic:
1. No Hard Resets/RNG manipulation.
2. No Instant Text
3. No Pokedoll skip (Using the pokedoll on the ghost in Pokémon Tower)

## What is Instant Text?

Instant Text is a natural oversight in the game where talking to the bike sales man without the bike voucher and closing his final dialog with B will set the text speed to instant. This isn't a glitch in the communities eyes, and is NOT permanent. Here are some things that kill IT:
- Opening the menu outside of battle
- Opening the Pokémon or Item menu in battle
- Any Yes/No textbox

## Why did the Glitchless WR video save and reset / What is RNG manipulation? / RNG Manipulation seems daunting, should I learn it right away?

- A1. You can manipulate RNG in Pokémon Red/Blue and again it is explained in the [RBY Manip Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QirPrbub21g) (yes this is the third time we've linked this video, watch it) which is all done by hard resetting the console (save and reset). With that you can get the perfect Nidoran, get no random encounters in Mount Moon, and solve the Surge cans puzzle first try. 
- A2. For Glitchless, yes you must perform just one simple rng manip to get a nidoran with perfect stats. There is a medium difficulty version and a super easy version of the manip. 
- A3. For Classic, rng manips are actually just banned so you can get going right away. 
- A4. For Blue NSC, rng manips are essential - completeing a run of Blue NSC is actually a great way to learn rng manips and become less worried by them. 


## Why is my manip failing?

It's most likely you are doing something wrong:
1) A Presses - You have a 17 frame window to press A and you don't just want to lightly tap it make sure it's pressed! [Picture of A Press window](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/425297133382533122/741663432633221161/image0.png) Hold A longer-than-is-intuitive.
2) Intro - Everything from the the hard reset needs to match. EVERYTHING. The intro included. If the video shows an input you have to do it the same.
3) Movement - You want to do the movement 100% correctly so double check. Also make sure you are holding the first direction as the game loads. You are basically buffering the first movement.
4) IGT (In Game Time) - There is a small chance your manip will fail and we call it an IGT failure. If you get the same failure every time you try or, you suddenly get failures after learning a manip it might be IGT.
5) MISC. - There could be 100 things going wrong, but you can ask in the #red-blue-glitchless channel in the PSR discord. We recommend recording yourself doing the manip with an input viewer.

Make sure to watch the [RNG manipulation tutorial video](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/guide/9oea2)!

## What is triple extended manip?

You can do 3 manips that are [extended](triple-extended/) from the Nidoran manip.
1) Pidgey manip and catch.
2) Forest no encounter manip
3) String Shot turn 1 from the Bug Catcher in Forest

WARNING: This manip only saves about 20 seconds and can be extremely hard to learn. We suggest getting times around 1:50 before even trying to learn this manip, as your time is better spent learning other sections of the run.

## I'm learning Glitchless, but in which order should I learn things? When should I drop the beginner route?

This page is a good roadmap of what to learn depending of your current time:
- [Red Glitchless: Begin to Advanced](https://pastebin.com/UUpT5n27)

## When should I reset my runs?

The simple answer is try not to reset. Set a PB then if you even have a small chance of beating that time finish out the run!

## But the early game is too good in my PB!

If you are reading this, you most likely have huge amounts of timesave in the late game and you never need to reset the early game, see this page:
- [How to get better times in Red](https://pastebin.com/xLE6W0eK)

## Any tips for improving my time?

Races are a great way to improve. You are actively playing with other runners, working on the entire run. [This discord](https://discord.gg/4mAWWz6) is a great place to find other runners to race.

## Why do you do X in the run?

You can ask any questions about the route in the PSR discord. We keep the guides simple for new runners, but there is a lot that goes into routing.

## When should I heal?

You can follow one of these pages or refer to your guide:
- [Safety-oriented HP Strats](hp-strats-for-races.md)
- [Aggressive HP Strats](hp-strats.md)
- For Classic runners, hp strats are either embedded into the guide or you should be using Red Helper to know damage ranges based on DVs.

## What should I practice the most?

The late game is important to practice. Many new runners get the early down by doing runs but struggle on good runs in the late game.

## Are there practice saves? How do I use the Save State Patcher?

Yes! And both are found on the [resource page](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/resources). Download the Save State Patcher and the states for the game you are learning. Open an unmodified Red Rom via the patcher, drag and drop the states you want, save with a file name like red practice .gbc, load the practice rom into your emu and press Down + Select + B to load up a nice save state menu. 

## Should I be saving during runs?

Yes! When starting out saving is a great idea. Here is a list of good saving points in the run:
- Before Brock (Bad Special)
- Before Shorts Guy (in Classic)
- Before the Oddish girl in Rock Tunnel (Low HP)
- Before Black Belt in Giovanni's Gym
- Before Agatha (if zero revives)
- Before Lance
- Before Champ Fight
