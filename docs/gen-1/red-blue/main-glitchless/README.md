## What Glitchless (or Classic) route do I choose?
- Different routes exist to optimize how long it takes to get a specific goal time. How you play to get a sub 1:55 in Glitchless (sub 2:05 in Classic) efficiently is much different than how you play to get a sub 1:47 in Glitchless (sub 1:57 in Classic). 
- **Beginner routes** are recommended if you are first starting out. They are focused on allowing as many runs as possible to be completed, which is great for learning the game.
  - Note that you can continue using beginner routes even as you improve. Times as low as 1:47 in glitchless and 1:59 in classic have been obtained using versions of beginner routes.
- Intermediate routes are focused toward goal times where dying would make PBs unlikely/impossible, so they cut out revives. These routes still play safer than the advanced/WR routes, namely skipping high-risk strategies such as Silph Red Bar. The intermediate routes were written with goal times around 1:47 or slower for glitchless (1:59 or slower for classic) in mind. 
- The advanced routes are mainly focused toward goal times of 1:45/1:46 or better in glitchless (1:55-1:57 or better in classic), where you will likely have to consistently go for more risky red bar strategies.
- Turning solely to glitchless - the WR Route is focused toward goal times of 1:44/1:43, where you skip the Agatha Candy (usually picked up in Mansion) resulting in a riskier Agatha and Champ fight. Note that runners recently favor using the Advanced Flex Route over the WR route when performing 1:44-or-better attempts.
- We recommend that new players start off with whichever category they prefer; however, it is worth noting that the classic beginner route does contain more embedded maps to assist runners who have not played red in a long time. The glitchless route assumes that you already know how to beat the game normally and either understand or are willing to learn [how RNG manips work in Generation 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QirPrbub21g).
