* [WR Route](WR-Route)
* [Race Route](race-route/)

## What route do I choose?
- Different routes exist to optimize how much time it takes to get a specific goal time. The way you play to get a sub 1:55 time efficiently is much different than the way you play for a sub 1:47 time.
- The beginner route is recommended if you first start out. It is focused toward being able to complete as many runs as possible, which is great for learning the game. You can also continue to use this route as you improve, as people have gotten times as low as 1:47s with this route.
- The intermediate route is focused toward goal times where dying would make PBs unlikely/impossible, so it cuts out revives. This route still plays safer than the advanced route, namely skipping highly risky strategies like Silph Red Bar. This route is mostly written with goal times around 1:47 or slower in mind.
- The advanced route is mainly focused toward goal times of 1:45/1:46 or better, where you are likely to have to consistently go for more risky red bar strategies.
- The WR Route is mainly focused toward goal times of 1:44/1:43, where you must go for risky red bar strategies and have a riskier Agatha and Champ fight.
