# Pokemon Red Glitchless Classic Beginner Guide

### Good Documents and Resources

- [How To Speedrun Pokemon on Emulator](https://youtu.be/nf51DyXg-OY)
- [Red Glitchless and Red Classic FAQ](https://pokemon-speedrunning.github.io/speedrun-routes/#/gen-1/red-blue/main-glitchless/resources/faq)
- [Resources - Pokémon Red/Blue](https://www.speedrun.com/pkmnredblue/resources)
	- Optional: Download "Red Classic Helper" and see [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/d9LGAo8) for beginner settings
	- SAVES: Download "Any% Glitchless (Classic)"
 	- RBY Savestate Patcher can be used to make your own practice ROM

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for Pokemon Red
	- Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a Classic speedrun is not allowed
	- If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
	- Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from Classic

### Before you start

- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator**
- Set your options to Fast Text and Animations OFF

## NIDORAN SPLIT

Name yourself and rival “A” or any one character.

Pick up the PC Potion.

Name Squirtle one character.

> Naming Squirtle “B” can help avoid confusion later when checking stats on Brock and teaching moves throughout the run, assuming you plan to name Nidoran “A”

Rival 1:
- Tail Whip + spam Tackle

> Tail Whip turn 2 if growled turn 1
> - This is slower on average but has a higher win rate

> Optional: check stats on level up after Rival 1
> - 11 SPC is likely bad special (3 hit on Geodude and/or Onix)
> - 12 SPC is guaranteed good special (2 hit on Geodude & Onix)

Route 1
- Spam Tackle to faint one encounter that is L2 or L3

> This early EXP will get Bubble for Brock

Viridian Mart
- Buy 8 Poke Balls

Walk west to the grass patch on Route 22.

Optional - Save the game before searching for Nidoran.

- Catch a L3 or L4 Nidoran♂ and give it a one-character name
	- L3 Nido: Tackle once before throwing Poke Balls
	- L4 Nido: just throw Poke Balls
	- L5 Spearow: just throw Poke Balls, since it outspeeds us

> Next are tables you can use if you are familiar with DSUM. For your first runs you can just search randomly in the grass until you get a Nido. For more explanations on DSUM, see the [video tutorial by Shenanagans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqC8cfI5XSs) and the [video tutorial by Gunnermaniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxhT2H0GTwA).
