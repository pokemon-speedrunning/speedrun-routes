</details>

- This guide will always offer Carbos + extra candy strategies to avoid being outsped by Sabrina's Zam (which forces us to set up a very risky X-Speed on Mr. Mime who is 1/3 to use confuision 1/3 to use barrier).
  - Carbos strategies that are optional have the Speed DVs in ( ) the DVs that have optional carbos pickups are (3-4) and (11-12).
  - 3 SPD plays safe with 3 Carbos + extra candy in mansion
  - 4 SPD plays safe with 2 Carbos + extra candy in mansion
  - 11-12 SPD plays safe with 2 Carbos to outspeed Agath's 1st Gengar this timeloss gives us a less risky Agatha fight (we still heal, but only risk her 2nd Gengar that knows fewer scary moves)

- This guide avoids higher risk red bar strategies by default, but they are available for runs that fall too far behind. Note that Flute-to-End times under 44 minutes are achievable in classic with solid execution and sub 11:00 Fly split is achievable without fly red bar.

- If not going for a top leaderboard time it is suggested to use one of the safer strats involving extra candies instead of X Speed Sabrina strats.
- See [this pastebin explanation](https://pastebin.com/sEWrd0v8) and the [complete speed chart](https://imgur.com/MpKBIb1) for more information.

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide

	- If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once

Things to consider:
- There are options here with pros and cons to weigh. Play safely on good enough pace.
WA is 28 damage or 25 damage w/badge boost
- X Speed first 23-27 is an option; as is Full Restore or Super Potion if Sky Attack turn 1 on good pace
- Yolo Strat at 1-23 or 28-30 or just in red bar is to X Acc turn 1 and respond to Sky Attack with HD and take the risk using X Speed on Zam (~⅓ to live)
