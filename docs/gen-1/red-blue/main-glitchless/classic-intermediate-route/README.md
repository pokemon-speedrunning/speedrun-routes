This guide suggests using safer strats involving carbos and/or rare candies instead of X Speed Sabrina strats with 3+ Speed DV. See [this document explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaLiYjPanRiGSnToYBXKrEx47xVX7LlWNw5C81cBVN0/edit?usp=sharing) and the [complete speed chart](https://imgur.com/MpKBIb1) for more information.

### Glossary

- Moves: HA = Horn Attack, BB = Bubblebeam, WG = Water Gun, TB = Thunderbolt, PS = Poison Sting, HD = Horn Drill, IB = Ice Beam, RS = Rock Slide
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- Livesplits has an autosplitter built in for Pokemon Red on emulator
	- Activate within “edit splits” and then go into settings to set your preferences for where you want to split
- Hard Resetting **during** a Classic speedrun is not allowed
	- If you ever take a safety save into a death during the run, then you can only **soft reset** using **A + B + Start + Select** held at once
	- Hard Resetting the console means that RNG Manipulation is technically possible and this is banned from Classic

### Before you start

- Clear any existing save file by pressing **Up + B + Select** on the game title screen
- Hard Reset (set palette with Up + B - optional to give full visibility in Rock Tunnel), **hard resetting is required before each attempt on emulator**

> There is an alternative strategy to delay using this candy to EQ Menu if you have 0-2 speed and do not want to X Speed Sabrina's Mr. Mime, but...      
> ... this guide will assume that you are not using this safety strategy.

> 3+ Speed DV, play normally since you will naturally outspeed Sabrina's Alakazam     
> if you chose to play aggressively with 3 or 4 Speed DV and skipped the suggested # of carbos and skipped the extra candy,

> If turn 1 Sky Attack, use Full Restore (or Super Potion or Potion) in order to live non crit Sky Attack.

- Pidgeot: X Speed + X Accuracy + HD
- Alakazam: HD 
- Rhydon: HD
- Gyarados: HD

> If desparate for Champ Red Bar to PB only Potion if you can keep red bar and consider the advanced notes for Champ copied below where we typically use X Acc turn 1:   
> If you are playing champ safely, you can ignore the notes below.   

Turn 1 Sky Attack Basics:
- Yolo Strat after using X Acc turn 1 is to HD Pidgeot, X Speed on Zam (~⅓ to live), and HD all. 
- Safe Strat after using X Acc turn 1 is to either Full Restore (or Super Potion if it heals enough).
- Yolo Strat after using X Speed turn 1 is to either...
  - X Acc turn 2 and hope for a miss or
  - Yolo Drill Pidgeot, EQ(+EQ) Zam, X-Acc Rhydon, HD the rest. 
- Safe Strat after using X Speed turn 1 is to...
  - Full Resore if you are using x-speed in red bar
  - Super Potion if you are using x-speed w/"high" HP

Further explanation regarding when to consider X Speed turn 1:
- Using X Speed first is a good option if...
  - (1) it allows you to live one non-crit Wing Attack that otherwise would have KO'd without a defense badge boost 
  - (2) if it allows you to respond to turn 1 Sky Attack with Super Potion resulting in red bar off of any non-crit. 
- As an example, consider a Nido w/ 7 Defense DV.
  - (1) with ~23-26 HP we might X Speed turn 1 to guard against wing attack.
  - (2) with ~41-5X HP we might X Speed turn 1 to allow us to respond to sky attack with Super Potion.
