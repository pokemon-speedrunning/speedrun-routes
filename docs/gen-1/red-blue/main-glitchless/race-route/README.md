# Pokemon Red Glitchless Race Route (NO IT-FlexLass-3Repels-PPUp)

**This is one of the many race routes people use and most of them are as good. I decided to document this because it was used by all 3 finalists at the 2020 Red Tournament.**
**You can find the VOD of the Finals [here](https://youtu.be/owoeSjzdqL0), it's a good example of this route in action.**
