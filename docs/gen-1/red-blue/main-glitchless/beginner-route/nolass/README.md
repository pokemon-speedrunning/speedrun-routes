## Mount Moon

- Do not learn a full Moon Manip for your first runs, start by learning [Post Hiker Backup Paras](https://pastebin.com/j5gtY4cy) (or the [older version](https://pastebin.com/7kcZu3g4)) and walk through the first floor normally ([movement map](https://i.imgur.com/xzgmNBk.jpeg)). You will choose later if you want to learn [Route 3 Moon](https://pastebin.com/tggXpQRC) (optimal for this route) or [Entr Moon](https://pastebin.com/jnj9j47S) (slightly less optimal, but still perfectly fine). There is also a [Post Nerd Backup Paras](../../resources/postnerd-backup-paras.md) you can learn.
