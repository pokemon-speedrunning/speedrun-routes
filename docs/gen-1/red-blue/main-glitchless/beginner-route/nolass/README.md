**Agatha:**
- Gengar: X Spec + EQ
	- If you get put to sleep use the Poke Flute, and if you get confused risk it since you would need to X Spec again if you swapped
- Golbat: Blizz
	- If you miss Blizz, and Golbat uses Haze, use
		- 2x TB on Golbat
		- Consider using a Super Potion on Arbok at 25-60 (or use X Speed if you bought 3)
		- 25 HP and lower has red bar, and is usually worth taking the risk
		- You are slower than the last Gengar, so it will have a turn to use a move on you
	- If you miss Blizz, but Golbat doesn't use Haze, use Blizz again, or TB if out of Blizzards
- EQ x3

Menu before Lance:
- Use Elixer
- Heal using the chart below
- [OPTIONAL SAVE: Lance is somewhat likely to kill you, so saving is recommended]

- Feel free to use your Full Restore if you picked it up and you want to play really safe

- Gyarados: X Spec + TB
- Dragonair 1: Blizz
- Dragonair 2: X Spec + Blizz (use X Speed instead if you have one)
