# Pokemon Red Glitchless Beginner Guide, Lass Version

**FAQ: [Please read the FAQ before learning :)](../../resources/faq.md)**

### Manip quick reference
- Watch the [RBY Manip Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QirPrbub21g)
- Nidoran Manip:
	- [7A Press - Optimal](../../resources/nido-manip.md) (Highly recommended)
	- [1A Press - Easy](https://youtu.be/2bwQZ6jPxRE)
- Mount Moon Manip:
	- [Post Hiker Backup Paras v1](https://pastebin.com/7kcZu3g4) ([2A Press Path](https://i.imgur.com/jp61CLR.png), [video w/ Select yoloball inputs](https://youtu.be/atQiH670ENs))
	- [Post Hiker Backup Paras v2](https://pastebin.com/j5gtY4cy) (7A press, normal yoloball)
	- Grogir's [Post Zubat Backup Paras](https://pastebin.com/5rKmACtf) 
	- [Post Nerd Backup Paras](../../resources/postnerd-backup-paras.md)
	- [Entr's Full Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/jnj9j47S) (Optimal for this route)
       - [Route 3 Full Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/tggXpQRC) (Route 3 does not work with this route due to fighting the Rt3 Lass, but is optimal for the main speedrun route)  
- Surge Cans Manip:
	- [Optimal Cans Manip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pa2f2WxCe4)
      - 58/60 success rate with 2A presses
      - 57/60 success rate with zero A presses (same path, same cans)
      - If this cans manip fails there is no need to resave, just hard reset and do the other version (it'll work because they don't share any failure frames).  
	- [Palette Cans](https://youtu.be/_tWhfBITf_g) (allows you to see through Rock Tunnel by changing the palette)
	- [60/60 Cans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6pXrZ9_Vq0) (slightly slower + harder, but great success chance)

### Good documents
- [Defensive Damage Ranges](../../resources/defensive-ranges.md)
- [Offensive Damage Ranges](../../resources/offensive-ranges.md)
- [Safety-oriented HP Strats](../../resources/hp-strats-for-races.md)
- [Trainer Data Sheet](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/an4xn77nxpyu1noz453nj/Pokemon-Red-trainer-guide.xlsx?rlkey=qi5v6pnrie4xy0e9hxjjiwkfj&e=1&dl=0)

### Glossary
- Moves: TW = Tail Whip, HA = Horn Attack, PS = Poison Sting, WG = Water Gun, MP = Mega Punch, BB = Bubblebeam, TB = Thunderbolt, RS = Rock Slide, HD = Horn Drill, Blizz = Blizzard.
	- (+ MOVE): A situational move used to finish off a pokemon when a damage range is missed
- IT = Instant Text

### Important Notes
- When learning a new move you cannot hit up to make the cursor wrap around to the bottom slot like you can in battle. For example, to teach over Slot 4, you must press down three times. Don't accidentally delete the wrong move.
- Practice the Lorelei split/segment (Victory Road movement, in particular) - watch and replicate either the [optimal Super Repel locations](https://youtu.be/Dq05fXW7k-4) or this [easier version of Victory Road / Lorelei Segment](https://youtu.be/AbekvWHeX50) (~5 seconds slower).
     - This guide assumes that you will use the optimal strategy in Victory Road, going slower/safer is optional. Note that the slower strategy still works if you accidentally wasted a Super Repel earlier, so it is worth knowing as a backup. 

### Before you start
- Clear any existing save file by pressing Up + B + Select on the game title screen
- Options: Text Speed **Fast** and Animations **Off**

## Pallet Town

- Name yourself and rival 'A' (or any one-character name)
- Pick Squirtle (middle ball) and name it 'A'

#### Rival 1
- TW + spam Tackle

> **L6 Squirtle Stats**      
> 10 ATK --> TW x3 on Weedle Guy     
> 11 SPC --> likely bad Special for Brock      
> No need to reset over bad Squirtle stats, just be aware of them.       

## Parcel Quest

> Go up Route 1 to get Oak's Parcel from Viridian Mart.    
> Return to Oak's Lab, give him the Parcel, and get the Pokedex.     
> Go back up Route 1 (back to the Viridian Mart).      

KO **one** L2 or L3 encounter at some point during these trips up and down Route 1 by **spamming Tackle**
- L2-3 Rat or L2 Pidgey are the easiest to KO without taking too much damage.
- L3 Pidgey is okay too, but deals a lot of damage to us. For this reason, run away from L3 Pidgey on your first pass of Route 1 with the hopes of seeing a better encounter later.
- Run from all L4-5 encounters and run from all encounters after you get EXP.
- This early EXP will give Squirtle an extra level up at the end of Viridian Forest which gives us the move Bubble in time for Brock.

## Viridian City

Viridian Mart:
- Buy **4 Poke Balls**
     - (or buy 5 Poke Balls and buy 1 less Potion later)

Nidoran Manip:
- [7A Press - Optimal (Highly Recommended)](../../resources/nido-manip.md)
- [1A Press - Easy](https://youtu.be/2bwQZ6jPxRE)

Get the [hidden Tree Potion](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#54/166)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H8JVzPL.png" height="100" >

## Viridian Forest

- Walk the path below in the forest to decrease the chance of getting wild encounters.
- Pick up the Antidote and the hidden Forest Potion (in front of Weedle Guy).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9wWTgkB.png"> 

> Note that only the tiles marked in red on the map can generate encounters. 

**Weedle Guy:** [1-6 HP: Potion]
- TW x2 + spam Tackle
    - TW x3 if Bad ATK (10 ATK @L6)
- Check your leveled up Special stat at the end of this fight (SPC is at the very bottom).
    - 13 SPC @L8 --> Bad Special (likely to take 3 Bubbles instead of 2 to KO Brock's Pokemon)

If you were poisoned, then menu immediately after the fight:
- Swap Squirtle with Nidoran
- Potion Squirtle to 16+ HP
- Use the Antidote

> If you were not poisoned, then delay this menu until one step into Brock's gym      
> (saves time this way, but it's fine if you do it earlier).       
> Note that swapping Nido to the lead is essential to swap-train Nido against Brock's Geodude & Onix.        
> --> Nido will reach L8 and learn Horn Attack after Brock's Onix.   

## Pewter City

Pewter Mart:
- **Buy 8 Potions**
     - (or buy 7 Potions if you bought 5 Poke Balls earlier)

If you were not poisoned, then menu one step into Brock's Gym:
- Swap Squirtle and Nidoran
- Potion Squirtle to 16+ HP
- Toss the Antidote
- [Optional: Save before Brock if you have Bad Special (13 SPC @L8)]

#### Brock:
- Geodude: [1-8 Potion]
   - Swap to Squirtle + Bubble x2-3
        - Say Yes + swap back to Nido
- Onix: [1-12 Potion, 1-14 after Screech]
	 - Swap back to Squirtle + Bubble x2-3
        - TURN 1 BIDE --> TW x2
        - If you Bubble after BIDE, keep using Bubble (do not Potion - due to a gen 1 bug, using Potion after a damaging move will cause Bide to KO)

**Options**: Battle Style to **Set** before leaving Brock's gym

## Route 3

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0lfYzCR.png">

**Bug Catcher 1:**
- Caterpie:
    - Leer + HA x2 (+ Tackle)
- Weedle: [1-9 Potion]
    - Leer + HA x2
    - (Tackle turn 3 if hit by String Shot)
- Caterpie:

	- HA x2
- **Kakuna**:
	- HAx3 (+ Tackle)
- **Caterpie**: [1-5 Potion]
    - HA x2 (only Tackle turn 2 if hit by 2+ stringshots before 1st HA hits or if HA crits)

    - PS x2 (HA turn 2 instead if low roll + not hit by String Shot)
- Metapod:
    - HA, PS, HA, PS 

#### Catch a flyer & KO one Encounter
- **L8 Pidgey**:
     - **HA** if you have one (otherwise: Leer + Tackle), then throw balls
- **any other Bird**:
     - **Tackle**, then throw balls
- KO one encounter in the grass with HA (except L3 or L7 Jigglypuffs)
     - This EXP will let Nido reach L15

## Mount Moon

> If you are not attempting a full moon manip for now,      
> then follow this [movement map](https://i.imgur.com/xzgmNBk.jpeg) to make it to the backup paras manip below,       
> run from any random encounters.       

#### Enter Mt. Moon and open the Menu immediately
- Potion to 22+ HP

#### Save & Do [Entr's Full Moon Manip](https://pastebin.com/jnj9j47S)
- **Hold A on the Bios Screen** immediately after Hard Reset, Select Yoloball (or Normal Yoloball if in redbar)
- Get [TM12 (Water Gun)](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=59#5/32), [Rare Candy](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=59#35/31), [Escape Rope](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=59#36/23), [TM01 (Mega Punch)](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=61#29/5) and [Moon Stone](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=59#2/2)
- Performing a full Moon Manip is not required when starting out, but it doesn't hurt to attempt it and see how far you get.
- If you fail the manip at some point (or get an IGT failure), then just run from the extra encounters until you get to one of the backup manip locations below.
- Avoid trying to catch a random wild Paras since the catch is not guaranteed even at low HP, catch a manipped one instead.
