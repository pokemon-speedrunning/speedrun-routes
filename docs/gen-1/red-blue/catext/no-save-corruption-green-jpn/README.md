# Pokémon Green Any% No Save corruption
**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

## Before Starting

Make sure that you have **Release 1.0** of the game. The glitch that we are going to do works on 1.1 too, but it's slower because the manip to activate it is different.

## Before doing a new run

- On the New Game screen, go down and press A to go in the Options menu
- Then, change the first settings to the left and the second to the right
- The first settings is the text speed, which we set to fast, and the second settings is the battle animations, which we are toggling off.

## Intro

Name yourself and your rival with the **first two names** by pressing down then A.

## Before Rival fight

- Go to your pc on the top-left corner of your room and press A 3-4 times, and then press B twice.
	- By doing that, we are getting a potion who will help us all the time, for a glitch call [Dokokashira Door Glitch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dokokashira_door_glitch), and we need two objects for make it working.
- Then, go outside in the grass like as usual. After finishing the dialogues, choose Bulbusaur. The main reason is that the rival moves slowly, and taking Bulbasaur makes him travel less. The second reason is that we have to lose during the rival's fight, and Bublbasaur is the most "bad" of the three starters

## Rival Fight

Just **spam A**, and pray that you have good RNG and lose because it's faster.(Spamming A spams Tackle)

## Oak's Parcel

Once you finished the battle, go to the shop for getting Oak's Parcel. If you come across a pokémon, run away(Bottom right option).

## Glitch Activation

- Try to get into a battle on one of this two tiles before entering Pallet Town : [Tiles](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#60/231/U)
- Once in the fight, press right then A: it's the bag.
	- Press down once, and then press select.
	- Press B and press left, then down, then A and A again. (Quick explanation : We exchange our second item with our first Pokémon.)
	- If there are glitched characters on the screen, the glitch is activate. Press B, then Up, then A, and finally B. Run away.
- If there is the Prof Oak out of is lab, it's also that the glitch worked.

## Hall Of Fame Warp

- Follow this path [1](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#60/232/DDDDDDDDRRRRRRRR) [2](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#68/240/LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL) [3](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#51/240/rrrrrrrrrrrrrr) [4](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#65/240/llu) [5](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#116/119/RRRD) [6](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=186#1/3/RRURRRR) [7](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#134/120/RRRDDDRRRRRRDDDRRRRRRRRRUUUURRRRRRRRU)
	- For 5, YES we walk into the back of the house, and for 7, we can walk into the bush because there is no collisions here.
- You should be send in a weird place with glitched caracters everywhere. Text box should appears : it's Oak's dialogue at the Hall Of Fame. Just spam B and A.

## Troubleshoot

- [Dokokashira Door Glitch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dokokashira_door_glitch)
	- If there is no glitched characters in the pokémon menu in the fight, make sur that you have select the **second item** in your bag and press B, not A.
	- If the game crashes or freeze when you run away from the battle, it's that you haven't enter and exit the battle menu.
  	- If Prof Oak is not out of his lab, you did the glitch wrong Try it again.
  	- If you doesn't teleport to Route 7 when entering Blue's house, you took too many or fewer steps. The warp location changes every 4 steps, so be sure to **follow the path above in Pallet Town**.
  	- If you have others issues, try asking for help in the [PSR Gen1-3 Pokémon Speedruning Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/5qqmmAk), on the [gen-1 japanese channel](https://discord.gg/W5XfS8HB).
  	- (It's also helpfull for others run if you wants more explanations or tutorials, there are very nice over there :) )

## Notes

- This run is very based on RNG(Rival fight and random encounters can be very annoying, i know), so **don't be frustrated if you don't have good RNG**. The only thing to do is to restart your run.
- Names doesn't matters on this run, so if you miss the down buffer for the names and go to the "personalized" ones, don't worry, it's ok.
