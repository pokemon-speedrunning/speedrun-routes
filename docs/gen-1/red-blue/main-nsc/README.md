**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

Based on davidpoko's guide, which was based on krazyd4n's guide.

## Intro
- Manip TID F1C8 (61896)
  - [Faster, but slightly harder](https://youtu.be/hjFPSA1YEYk)
  - [Slower, but sligtly easier](https://youtu.be/u5_hDQ7H98w)
  - Note that the TID manip length doesn't impact the final time, it's only about reset efficiency
- Name yourself m<sup>M</sup><sub>N</sub>a.♀tF
  - The fastest way to do this is:
    - Select, Down, Right, Right, Right, A, Up, Up, Up, Up, Left, A, Down, Down, Down, A, Up, Up, Left, Left, Left, A, Left, Left, A, Left, Left, Left, Up, Up, A, Select, Right, Right, Right, Right, Up, Up, A, A.
- Name rival RED
  - You can buffer this by clearing the last textbox with B, then holding DOWN+A
- Bufer START as soon as the last textbox stopped printing
  - Press UP 2 times to go into option and set them to Fast/Off

## Route 1  + Viridian
- Pick Charmander
- Spam Scratch, losing is faster than winning
- Get the parcel and the Pokedex, run from any Route 1 encounter
- Buy 1 Pokeball from the Viridian Mart
- Heads toward Route 22 and [manipulate a Spearow and its yoloball](https://youtu.be/Juvj2kGndfo)
  - Do not load [this NPC](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?local=1#6/23) going to the save tile, otherwise the manip will fail
  - If [this NPC](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?local=1#13/20) moves on screen for the save tile, go left 2 tiles and do [this backup manip](https://youtu.be/8V8q03cT2Tg) instead
- Name it "AA"
- Enter the Viridian Pokemon Center, deposit Charmander and heal to set the Center as your spawn point
- Leave and head to Route 2

## Deathfly Glitch
- [Manipulate no encounter through the grass, a Pikachu encounter and a Thundershock critical to die in 1 turn](https://youtu.be/wmnWBtQiLag)
- The Thundershock part is the hardest but it's also not necessary to complete a run. Tips:
  - Don't mash through any text, but time them
  - As soon as the "Go! AA" text disappears, let go of the A button and quickly press Down or Up, then A
  - After getting Thundershock turn 1, you can save 4 steps in Route 2 by executing [this extended manipulation](https://pastebin.com/FYwz9mne)
- If you didn't get the Thundershock turn 1, spam any move until you die

## Bug Catchers
- Walk back to Viridian Forest
  - As soon as you enter, you will be challenged by the Bug Catcher you just avoided
- Spam Peck
- Once you finish you will be challenged again by the same Bug Catcher
- Spam Peck again
- Now walk to the [first Bug Catcher in the Forest](https://i.imgur.com/SS6ickY.png)
- Your movement will be laggy and he won't see you
- Walk to him and mash A till the dialogue appears
- Spam Peck again

## Hall of Fame warp
- After the battle, you should be warped to the Hall of Fame
  - If the game crashed, you probably got the 25% of the ACE to fail even if you did everything correctly
- Timer stops at the first full white frame after the last Hall of Fame textbox
