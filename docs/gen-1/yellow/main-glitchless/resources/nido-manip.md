# L6 Nidoran Male RNG Manipulation

This manip has a 3479/3600 (96.6%) chance of working, or 3226/3600 (89.6%) chance if you exclude the Nidorans with 0/1 special (15/12/15/0 and 15/13/15/1 DVs). HP wise you get either 8 or 13 except in one extremely rare case, but overall these stats are much better than what the original console manip produced.

Only takes 2 extra steps instead of 10 in the old manip, but you have a 10% to get an encounter when you step onto the savepoint, so about 4 of those steps are lost back on average. The manip will still work if you get the unlucky encounter. No need to do anything special in that case, just run away and then proceed immediately to saving.
 
As was the case with the old manip, I recommend that you not buffer your save when doing this. Pikachu being specifically below you is also important.
