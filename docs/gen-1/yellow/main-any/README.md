# Pokemon Yellow Any%
**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

## Intro
- Manip TID:
  - [6415 (25621)](https://youtu.be/WffIE2ubIak old)
  - [or 64EA (25834)](https://youtu.be/RjqDCth4GIk)
    - this manip saves 16 frames later into the run, but it's harder to pull of. More details in the video
- Name yourself ASH
- Name rival BLUE

## Save corrupt
- Open your menu and save:
  - on GBP or Gambatte, first reset then press A shortly after
  - on GBI, first press A then reset right after
- Save corrupting is a 4-frame windows, so you will probably need some practice with the timing
- Take 1 step down
- Open your Pokemon menu, swap
  - 9 -> 10
  - 12 -> 13
  - 13 -> 11
- Open Item, scroll down, swap
  - Boulderbadge  -> Carbos
    - if you are using 64EA (25834) TID, its TM34 -> Carbos
- Open Pokemon again, swap:
  - 11 -> 12
- Close the menu, if you did everything right you will be warped to HoF

## Troubleshoot
- Save corrupt:
  - If you have no CONTINUE option after resetting, you went way too early with the reset
  - If the game says 'save data is destroyed', you went a little too early with the reset
  - If you can load the game and your pokemon menu opens, good job you got it
  - If you can load the game but your pokemon menu doesn't open, you went too late with the reset
