BEFORE STARTING
Make sure your save file options are.
Text = Fast
Battle Animations = Off
Style = Set
Button Mode = L=A
Mashing A, B, and L simultaneously is the fastest way to mash text
Watch this video on if you’re a beginner to this speedrun or want to learn the newest methods in RNG Manipulation (this guide assumes the best stats)
Download this RNG Manipulation Program and set these options if you’re just starting out. Set these options instead once you learn the game well enough.
To help calculate offset for Flowtimer use this website starting /w 0 Offset
If on Nintendo DS change “$scope.fpses = [59.7275]” to “$scope.fpses = [59.7275, 59.5666]” 
Pokemon LeafGreen has a version exclusive cut friend (Sandshrew) if you miss out on one in Route 1. Otherwise the version difference does not matter.
The first 6 steps on normal grass, 7 steps in Viridian Forest, and 8 Steps in Mt.Moon are a 1% chance to get an encounter. This 1% 6/7/8 rule restarts after every brand new encounter.
Recommend avoiding 28 Special Attack unless really good stats

NOTE DETAILS
* 	= Torrent
( ) 	= 1/16 damage range to die
| 	= No stat changes on the left | +1 to the defensive stat on the right

NEW GAME
Choosing the boy or girl is preference
Give yourself a 1-character name (“A” is fastest)
Give your rival a 1-character name (“A” is also the fastest)

PALLET TOWN
Check and insert your Trainer ID into the RNG Manipulation Program

Walk outside then head north towards the grass have Oak stop you

Mash through text until you can pick and manipulate Squirtle

Head down and fight your rival

Rival 1:
	Bulbasaur: Tackle Spam						0-13 Speed Ties
Tail Whip turn 1 if Modest or 0-3 Atk Rash/Mild
Reset if Bulbasaur ever outspeeds you

ROUTE 1 & 2
Grab the potion from mart guy

Kill any level 2 or 3 Pidgey/Rattata along the way 
Don’t kill a lv 3 Pidgey if Modest or less than 21 Attack
If 31 IV speed, attempt to kill an extra Pidgey/Rattata on Route 1

Grab the parcel at the mart then head back to Oak’s lab

Catch Rattata and Pidgey if you come across them (tackle once to weaken)
Don’t try to force an encounter since there’s backups later

On Route 2 cut through the grass before the Viridian Forest entrance (2nd tile to the right) it is 1% to get an encounter

VIRIDIAN FOREST
Avoid all non mandatory trainers

Grab the antidote near the sign above the 2nd Bug Catcher

Grab this hidden potion if necessary
Let the Bug Catch walk to you from the middle tile if not grabbing the Potion.
Bug Catcher Sammy:
Weedle: Tail Whip x1-2, Tackle x4-6
Swap Tail Whip with Tackle turn 1 before using it (Right + Select, A + A)
Bubble spam if level 7 for Bug Catcher
