General Information:
Always delete your save (UP+B+Select on Title screen) and set your options before starting.

(rest of the settings are preference, but L=A is recommended for mashing)
Fast text speed prints one character per frame, making one character names faster for your Trainer name and nicknames of Pokemon used in battles. Holding B after the copyright text fades out skips the intro video, spam A (and/or Start) for the title screen.

Companion Spreadsheet for this route: Emerald Routing (Abra 2.1)
Fights to consider saving before are marked with [!]. 

Intro & Mudkip manip:
Important: Early game movement has to be exact for Abra Manip to work!
Go down stairs, then visit Rival’s house, leave his room immediately, then go north for the starter. Save in front of the bag (one tile away also works if you move and use the bag immediately).
Offset (Flowtimer) 17100, check for: (Note: Offsets might differ on NDS!)
♂Zig, 
♂ Male Mudkip 21HP(21IV)
Naughty Nature
14 Atk (23IV),11 Def (28IV), 11 Sp. Atk (30IV), 9 Sp. Def (29 IV), 10 Speed (29 IV)

Name your mudkip with 1 character.
Go north to beat Rival 1, talk to him from the left.
Crit-Expert Brendan:

Go back to Oldale and use the west exit.

Route 102 and Petalburg:

Route 103 and Petalburg Forest:
Walk around the grass using the beach (the Youngster is a trainer!). Go to the upper grass on the lower half and menu:
Heal with a Potion
Use a Repel
In the forest run manip the first trainer and follow the path.
Team Aqua Grunt:
Poochyena: Tackle a lot; He does: 5-6 (+1: 5-7 | +2: 8-10 | +3: 9-11 | +4: 11-14)
Run Manip the next trainer (beginners should consider grabbing the ether after this trainer in case of PP issues later, most notably between Tate & Liza and Archie).
Run Manip or just dodge the rotato, then go up the water to avoid the Lass.
The double battle won’t happen, as you do not have a 2nd Pokemon yet.
Enter Rustboro City and go to the gym immediately.

Abra Manip and saving Peeko:
Exit the Gym and go to the left. After the cutscene run along the left wall of the gym around the corner. After talking to Devon Guy save and manip yourself an Abra:
Beginner basic Abra manip: https://youtu.be/SgVkNgwt6hI
Advanced strat: New Abra/Chain manip https://youtu.be/6S0qkJq2AdE
This video is slightly outdated and we can now chain taillow off of the hollow frames using a path which gets the encounter on the same tile as tricky.
The current strategy is to add 1200 to the offsets in the guide above, setting the interval to 600ms (rather than the default 500). For tricky frames input on the third beep, for hollow frames input on the fifth for both the ball through and B to nickname.
Tricky movement is the same, video of the new hollow movement by craftedite: https://youtu.be/qyA0IOrzF7I
All taillows have been confirmed to work on consoles for both hollow and tricky besides “Full monty” which does not work on hollow frames.

Repel at the end of the grass while bag manipping the two spinners, once passed, run manip the Youngster, making the Hiker walk up to you.
Hiker Devan:
Geodude: Water Gun (don’t learn Bide)
Geodude: Water Gun
Move up IMMEDIATELY, then run into the cave and fight the Aqua Thug.
Team Aqua Grunt:
Poochyena: Water Gun (twice without Torrent)
Leave the cave, use the ledge to skip past the Youngster and run back, bag manipping or pause manipping Karen and using the lower path run manip Bug Catcher Jose. Grab the repel below and to the left of Bug Catcher Jose.

Meet up with the Devon person again. After the Match Call Tutorial use Teleport and enter Petalburg Mart:

Leave the mart and exit the town to the east. 
If you didn’t get a Taillow use wingull manip:
Save by the last tree on the top of Petalburg by Wally’s house, facing left.
Upon loading save, immediately run left and up into the furthest right column of grass
Wingull encounter should be on the third tile of grass in the corner of the ledge
https://pastebin.com/fNBWXvN1 (offsets here are for NDS, so will need adjusting)
Offsets timing is for loading save, entering bag, throwing ball
(For wireless adapter: 10981/24583/27333, yoloball may not be correct)
If you miss the yoloball, you can water gun then throw a ball.
Optionally, grab the hidden potion on the beach immediately below and to the left of Briney’s cottage (very useful if low on potions).

Press B to decline the Rivals battle request and let Briney bring you to Dewford City.

Dewford City Visit 1:
After arriving in Dewford immediately head north to Granite Cave. Once inside use a Repel.
Get the Escape Rope on the 1st Floor, then use the ladder and follow this movement (other movements are fine if they are the same number of tiles):

You are going to need to use another Repel on B2F, after using it scroll your cursor to the escape rope. Talk to Steven from the side, then use the Escape Rope from earlier to exit the cave.

Go back to the boat and sail to Slateport.

Slateport City:
After the boat trip (optionally grab the hidden Revive to the right and) get the Soft Sand from the girl. Go up from here, turn left when above the Sailor and up again 1 tile before the Tuber. (You can save two tiles of running by going around the chair to the left of the tubers and talking to the girl from the top)

In Slateport continue north until the Shipyard, where you need to talk to the NPC at the table. He will tell you to find Stern at the Museum north of here. 
Upon exiting the Shipyard, turn left and menu to equip the Soft Sand on mudkip.
Run up into the museum. Be a good girl and pay for your visit there (-$50).
Talk to Stern on the upper floor. Team Aqua will show up to be bad.
Team Aqua Grunt 1:
Carvanha: Tackle x2, Mud-slap. Teach Mud Shot over Growl (slot 2) after Evolution.
Team Aqua Grunt 2:
Zubat: Tackle x2
Carvanha: Mud Shot
Archie will use Brain.exe and not battle you, so leave the Museum and head north.
After Birch annoys you keep right to avoid running into a double battle.
PokéFan Isabel:
Plusle: Mud Shot
Minun: Mud Shot (twice if got 2 Growls)
PokéFan Kaleb:
Minun: Mud Shot
Plusle: Mud Shot (twice if got 2 Growls and missed 62.5% range)
Continue North and run in the middle. Before the grass menu and use a repel. Run until bottom left of the Youngster, then walk 2 tiles right and pause or bag manip to pass the youngster on the right. If you get the 1/8 spin, run back two tiles, walk forward 2 tiles and try again.
Pick up the Full Heal in the gap in the grass to the right:

		  Heal to >45HP (can risk at >36HP) and kill with Mud-Slap
Grovyle: Mud Shot, Tackle (if at <10HP, use a Potion first) Absorb does 30-36, Quick Attack does 7-9. If <= 8 HP, use a potion before tackling to avoid dying to QA.
Wingull: Tackle x2 (its Water Gun does 8-10, can water gun the second hit to avoid risking the 5% miss). Don’t learn Foresight.
Continue the path, initiate a fight with the biker from below and then the Psychic from below.
Triathlete Alyssa:
Magnemite: Mud-Slap or Water Gun if you have Torrent (87.5% range)
Psychic Edward:
Abra: Deals 2-3 dmg (5-6 with crit), kill with Mud-Slap
Grab the Elixir on the right and head to Mauville City and enter the house below the Bike Shop to grab Rock Smash, then go get your Mach Bike ExtraBonk Edition™.
Outside the Bike shop menu:
Teach Rock Smash over Tackle
Register and Use Mach Bike
Bike 1 tile down then right and fight the Youngster.
Youngster Deandre:
Zigzagoon: Water Gun if Torrent or Mud Shot
Aron: Water Gun
Electrike: Water Gun if Torrent or Mud-Slap
Heal at the local Pokemon Center, then head west and talk to Wally at the Gym.
PKMN Trainer Wally:

Mauville City Gym:
↓ Follow this movement
Youngster Ben:
Zigzagoon: Mud Shot (56.25% range, if missed Water Gun)
Gulpin: Mud Shot (+0 OHKO | -1 12.5%, if missed Water Gun)
Leader Wattson:

Magneton: Mud Shot
Manectric: Mud Shot; QA does 10-12 (+1: 14-17), Mud Shot again if it lived.
Route 111 to 113:
Head north, bike past the first Spinner (won’t spin yet) and adjust 1 tile to the left to dodge the next one. Stop at the stone wall where pictured and Repel. Bike past the Rotato (top path) and bonk into the stairs/sign. Run to bike or bag manip the Hiker on the left to enter Fiery Path.

After Fiery Path bag manip the double Spinners (Repel runs out in front of them) and in the next Route bike south up to a rock, to reset the 3rd spinner for a load manip.

Continuing north avoid CTB by biking below her and use another Repel at the start of Route 113 next to a rock where the ash grass starts.

Following this path perfectly avoids all optionals without run/bag manips:

(Note: There 2 down tiles at the end are precisely where the roamers aren’t yet loaded, but you’re safe from the spinner to the right. You can also just stay on that line, but will bonk. You can instead go 1 tile above the double battle and go down before the final ledge and 1 tile up before the youngster for an easier movement which sacrifices some frames)
In Fallarbor get the Nugget on the crater and enter the Mart.

Meteor Falls to Rusturf Tunnel:
Decide whether or not to use protein (highly recommended). Benefits of protein courtesy of Exarion: https://pastebin.com/J81A66pE

Continue west then south. If you are not getting Protein Repel on the bridge where pictured. Bike 1 tile right to pass the spinner (she can turn!). If you are getting protein instead repel at the bottom of the bridge or by the boulder before you enter the grass.

Now continue the path towards Meteor Falls.

If using protein, after the first stairs rock smash the above boulder and grab it.
Bike around past the Rotato and fight the Hiker with the Picknicker looking south.
Hiker Lucas:
Geodude: Water Gun
Numel: Water Gun
Immediately after the battle, turn right and bag manip then bike around the Hiker. Run exactly 1 tile to run to bike the Picknicker (or bag manip if preferred), then continue. Bike up one extra tile after the stairs to avoid the Hiker.
(Advanced strat: Passing picknicker without bag manipping https://youtu.be/e7uvLSPntgY )
This requires hopping off the bike before fighting the hiker, then canceling the turn frame with mounting the bike after the battle.

After the cutscene use the stairs to the south inside the cave. Outside bag manip the Blackbelt when your Repel runs out and use a new Repel. Bike around the bottom of him if he’s facing up, or straight right to the boulder if facing left. Use Rock Smash and use the right section to pass by all Trainers. In Rustboro, immediately turn east. If you don’t bonk you can bike 1 tile above Bug Catcher Jose before he spins. Run to bike or bag manip Karen then stop in the middle before the double spinners. Bag Manip the spinners for the first pass, then run manip or run to bike the Youngster. Bike through Rusturf Tunnel and use Rock Smash to get Strength, then bike back to the entrance.

Outside wear out the repel, then teach Strength to Marshtomp over Mud-Slap, use a Super Repel, use the protein on marshtomp (if applicable), and use Teleport to get back to Mauville City. Bike east and initiate the fight with the Aroma Lady from her left:
Aroma Lady Rose:
Roselia: Strength

You can bonk into the tree here to stop your bike for the bag manip. In the bag, elixir marshtomp then heal using the Super Potion while bag manipping the Camper, bike to the gym in Lavaridge City.

Surf south to Seafloor Cavern and use Dive at this rock:

Go through the underwater door, then dive up again. Bike up, through the door use the left path. Obvious rock puzzle here. You can pass the spinner with 1 bag manip.
You can also bonk the bike at the top after the second boulder, dismount, run until 1 tile below and right of the optional then walk up two and pause manip (see Ringo’s PB for an example)
In the next room go to the left again, smash the rock and push the upper leftmost boulder up.
Swim into the Torrent here, the intersections are: ► ► ◄. Hop on and off the bike to avoid audio lag then enter. Use the puzzle on the right side to avoid battles. The next room also features a puzzle (Push the left or right boulder first, there is another solution but it takes longer).
There are no encounters in the last room! If you still have to heal or safety save, do that before walking below Kyogre! Heal to above 27HP or full if no Torrent.

Escape Rope out and Fly back to Pacifidlog. From here Surf to Sky Pillar and repel as needed, surf over the double battle (under if all slaves dead), Go down to the right of the girl swimmer but right before her line of sight avoiding the guy on the right, then go down again until the boy swimmer is on the edge of the screen then continue right and be careful of the 2 other optionals on the way to sky pillar.

After the cutscene fly back to Pacifidlog for Sky Pillar 2 to catch Rayquaza (Follow the same path while swimming).
