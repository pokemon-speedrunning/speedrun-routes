Pokémon Sapphire Any% ENG Route

(@Kylovic) ( last updated: Feb. 21, 2020)




Before the run


WARNING: Some maps in the route might be outdated. I took them from the wiki’s very old route. Make sure to watch a Sapph run with the newest route and copy the movement from there. Only use these maps as a guideline.


Spinner Manipulation

As all Pokémon games do, Sapphire has spinning trainers, known as spinners. Spinners can be avoided and should be at all costs. They are NOT taken into consideration, nor are they mentioned in this guide.

To learn more about how to manipulate spinners, please read this pastebin by Exarion covering the mechanics for gen3 spinners in full detail. [Exarion’s pastebin]


Color Code

Test that is highlighted in green denotes a trainer you need to fight. This is purely for the ease of reading. Some text other than Trainers is also marked in different colors which just denotes more important stuff. Menus where you heal / teach TM's / use items etc. are marked in italic and underlined again for ease of reading.


Pokémon Manipulations

This route only assumes one manipulation which is the Mudkip manipulation. You need to manip the Mudkip otherwise the run is impossible. Other than Mudkip there are other manips you can do (including Wingull and Kyogre) however the route does not require you to. If you are just starting out I would not recommend learning any other manips and focus on learning Mudkip manip and the route in general. Learn other manips once your time gets lower.
